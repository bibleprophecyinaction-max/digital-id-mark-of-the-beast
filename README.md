# One Digital ID to Rule Us All – Mark of the Beast Technology

Many Bible scholars believe the world is moving toward the system described in Revelation 13 where no one can buy or sell without the Mark of the Beast.

Modern technologies such as Digital ID, biometrics, artificial intelligence, and digital currency are rapidly developing worldwide.

Revelation 13:16-18 says that all people will be required to receive a mark in order to participate in the global economy.

## Technologies Preparing the System

• Global Digital ID  
• Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)  
• Biometric identification  
• Artificial Intelligence  
• Cashless commerce  
• Global governance systems

These technologies together could make it possible to control buying and selling worldwide.

## Global Developments

Organizations and global institutions are discussing digital identity systems and integrated financial networks that connect people, devices, and governments.

Biometric systems such as iris scans and palm recognition payments are already being tested.

Such systems demonstrate how a future global economic control system could become possible.

## Biblical Warning

The Bible warns that during the future tribulation period a world leader known as the Antichrist will enforce this system.

Those who follow Jesus Christ are promised salvation and deliverance from the coming judgment.
